    Microsoft Windows, commonly referred to as Windows,
    is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families,
    all of which are developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain
    sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT
    and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Server or
    Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE).
    Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x,
    Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.
    Microsoft Windows (also referred to as Windows or Win) is a graphical operating system
    developed and published by Microsoft. It provides a way to store files, run software,
    play games, watch videos, and connect to the Internet.
    The first version of Windows, released in 1985,
    was simply a GUI offered as an extension of Microsoft’s existing disk
    operating system, or MS-DOS. Based in part on licensed concepts that Apple Inc.
    had used for its Macintosh System Software, Windows for the first time
    allowed DOS users to visually navigate a virtual desktop,
    opening graphical “windows” displaying the contents of electronic
    folders and files with the click of a mouse button, rather than
    typing commands and directory paths at a text prompt.
