<h3>
    Apple's iOS is one of the most popular smartphone operating systems,
    second only to Android. It runs on Apple hardware, including iPhones,
    iPad tablets and iPod Touch media players
<br> <br>
    Signature features of iOS include the App Store where users buy apps and download free software,
    an emphasis on security including strong encryption to limit what unauthorized users can extract from the phone,
    and a simple, streamlined interface with minimal hardware buttons.
<br> <br>
    The first version of iOS was released in June 2007,
    when the iPhone debuted on the market. iOS, an acronym for iPhone Operating System,
    is a Unix-based operating system powering all of Apple’s mobile devices,
    but the name iOS was not officially applied to the software until 2008,
    when Apple released the iPhone software development kit (SDK),
    enabling any app makers to create applications for the platform.
<br> <br>
    The overwhelming popularity of the iPhone was certainly driven by the effectiveness of iOS.
    Projections suggest that 2 billion iPhones will be sold by the end of 2018,
    making the device the single most successful products ever released into the market.
    Some estimates show that since launch in 2007, iOS has been responsible for more than $1 trillion in revenue for Apple.
<br> <br>
    The first version of iOS introduced the culture to the touch-screen smartphone,
    a significant cultural shift away from flip-phones and Blackberry-style devices.
    The iPhone combined many functions within a single device, including a camera,
    internet browser and media player alongside the phone and messaging, and the world would never be the same. 
<br> <br>
    Apple finally gave iOS its name in the second version,
    when the company also released its SDK to developers looking to build apps for the platform.
    FaceTime, Apple’s video chat software, was released in iOS 4.
    Version 4 also introduced multitasking capabilities in iOS devices.
<br> <br>
    iOS 5 delivered Siri, a voice-enabled personal assistant,
    as well as iMessage as a central messaging system and the iOS Notification Center.
    Subsequent releases of the software added Airdrop, Touch ID, Apple Pay, and the much-derided Apple
    Maps mapping system as well as myriad improvements on functionality and design.
