    The Android OS is an open source operating system primarily used in mobile devices.
    Written primarily in Java and based on the Linux operating system,
    it was initially developed by Android Inc.
    and was eventually purchased by Google in 2005.
    The Android operating system is symbolized by a green colored Android Robot logo.
<br><br>
    Android is an operating system for mobile devices.
    It is mostly used for smartphones, like Google's own Google Pixel,
    as well as by other phone manufacturers like HTC and Samsung.
    It has also been used for tablets such as the Motorola Xoom and Amazon Kindle,
    it's the most popular operating system in the world judging by the number of devices installed.
    Largely developed by Google, it's chiefly used on smartphones and tablets.
    Unlike iOS, it can be used on devices made by a variety of different manufacturers,
    and those makers can tweak parts of its interface to suit their own needs.
<br><br>
    Users can download custom versions of the operating system because
    large portions of it are open source, meaning anyone can legally modify it and publish
    their own. However, most people prefer to stick with the version that comes on their
    devices.
<br><br>
    Android, like iOS, comes with an application and media store called the Play Store
    built by Google. Some phone manufacturers and other organizations also offer their own
    stores to install software and media.
