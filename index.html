<h3>
    Operating systems define how a computer stores files, switches between different applications,
    manages memory, 
    keeps itself secure, and interacts with peripherals like printers and cameras.
    Different operating systems take different approaches to all of these, which is why you normally can't
    run a Windows program on a Macintosh computer and why permissions look different on an
    Android phone than on an iPhone. An
    operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together.
    Operating systems communicate with'
    the device’s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio,
    storage devices, and display.
    In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices. Operating systems
    use device drivers written 
    by hardware creators to communicate with their devices.Operating systems also include a
    lot of software—things like
    common system services, libraries, and application programming interfaces (APIs)
    that developers can use to write
    programs that run on the operating system.

<h3>  
The operating system sits in between the applications you run and the hardware, 
using the hardware drivers as the interface between the two. For example, when an application wants 
to print something, it hands that task off to the operating system. The operating system sends the 
instructions to the printer, 
using the printer’s drivers to send the correct signals. The application that’s printing doesn’t 
have to care about what printer you have or understand how it works. The OS handles the details
